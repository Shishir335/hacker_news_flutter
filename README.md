A clone app of Hacker News using Hacker News API.

Done by: A. K. M. Mahbub Ullah





























Overview

Welcome,
This is a clone project. Here I tried to make a clone Hacker News application by the help of Hacker News API. I used MVVM architecture during the development. The app is build using Dart language.

MVVM architecture

MVVM architecture is a Model-View-ViewModel architecture that removes the tight coupling between each component. Most importantly, in this architecture, the children don't have the direct reference to the parent, they only have the reference by observables. 

Sequence Diagram

The architecture of the project follows the principles of MVVM. The sequence diagram of the application is shown as:
